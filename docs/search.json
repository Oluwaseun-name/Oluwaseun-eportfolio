    "text": "Building this ePortfolio has been a transformative experience. At the beginning of this course, my familiarity with tools like Git, Quarto, and GitHub Pages was minimal. Now, I‚Äôve gained the confidence to use them independently to create and manage a professional website that showcases my skills and academic work.\n\n\n\n\nHow to use Quarto to create structured, multi-page websites\nManaging my code and content with Git version control\nPublishing to the web using GitHub Pages\nWriting cleaner, more professional content for a digital audience\nApplying Python and SQL to solve real data problems\nUsing SCSS to customize and enhance the visual design of my site\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were several points where I faced technical difficulties ‚Äî especially when setting up GitHub Pages, configuring _quarto.yml, and linking files across multiple pages. However, working through these issues helped me better understand how modern web development tools connect. I also became more comfortable with debugging errors and reading documentation.\nOne of the most satisfying moments was seeing my fully styled, live website come together ‚Äî with a clean layout, responsive navigation, and working project pages.\n\n\n\n\nThis portfolio represents more than a course project ‚Äî it‚Äôs a foundation I can build on. I plan to continue learning about:\n\nInteractive dashboards using Python\nBusiness intelligence tools like Power BI\nCreating data stories with visual tools like Plotly and Tableau\n\nI also aim to keep updating this portfolio with new projects and insights as I grow my career in business analytics and data storytelling.\n\n\n\n\nReflecting on this process has helped me realize how much progress I‚Äôve made ‚Äî not just technically, but in how I think, communicate, and organize my work. I now have a portfolio that not only presents what I‚Äôve done, but also who I am becoming as a professional."

    "text": "I am currently striving towards a Bachelor of Business Studies. I am currently working on different analytical platforms and tools. My favourite is Python, which is the best; I also work on SQL and Power BI. I also have experience as an intern at DoIT, and friends and family who are experienced in analytics. In the internship, I gained an understanding of and practical experience with cloud services in delivering data. I also enhanced my skills in data analytics and my abilities in tools such as Python and Power BI. These skills have been applied to schoolwork and modules where they are required, such as Business Analytics, Workflow & Data Management, Digital Marketing, Programming, & Visualisation.\n\n\n\nIn the future, I plan on using the analytical expertise I have gathered over the years in various situations, such as business strategies, organisational decision-making processes, and presentations. I aim to continue expanding my knowledge in emerging technology and analytical advancement, with my particular interest in machine learning and predictive analytics. Ultimately, I strive to use my analytical expertise to drive business innovation. I am passionate about technology and want to join an up-and-coming business.\n\n\n\n\nThe tools and techniques I‚Äôve developed are being applied directly to coursework and module projects in areas such as:\n\nBusiness Analytics\nWorkflow & Data Management\nDigital Marketing\nProgramming & Visualization\n\nEach of these modules has helped reinforce my skills while encouraging critical thinking and creativity in how I analyze and present data.\n\n\n\n\nCreating this portfolio has been a rewarding and challenging experience. It challenged me to be able to step outside my traditional boundaries of academic work and build something creative of my own. In this experience, I learned Quarto and managed control of it with GitHub to deploy a live website using GitHub Pages. The challenging aspect was learning how to structure the site using HTML, CSS and SCSS. Getting my design to look professional felt intimidating initially, but overcoming the obstacle improved the result. Overall, this gave me a deeper appreciation for thoughtful presentations and helped me reflect on my journey and the skills I developed, such as Python, SQL, and Data analysis."

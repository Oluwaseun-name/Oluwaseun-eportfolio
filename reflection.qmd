# ðŸ§  Reflecting on My Learning Journey

Building this ePortfolio has been a transformative experience. At the beginning of this course, my familiarity with tools like **Git**, **Quarto**, and **GitHub Pages** was minimal. Now, Iâ€™ve gained the confidence to use them independently to create and manage a professional website that showcases my skills and academic work.

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

- How to use **Quarto** to create structured, multi-page websites
- Managing my code and content with **Git version control**
- Publishing to the web using **GitHub Pages**
- Writing cleaner, more professional content for a digital audience
- Applying **Python** and **SQL** to solve real data problems
- Using **SCSS** to customize and enhance the visual design of my site

## ðŸš§ Challenges and Breakthroughs

There were several points where I faced technical difficulties â€” especially when setting up GitHub Pages, configuring `_quarto.yml`, and linking files across multiple pages. However, working through these issues helped me better understand how modern web development tools connect. I also became more comfortable with debugging errors and reading documentation.

One of the most satisfying moments was seeing my fully styled, live website come together â€” with a clean layout, responsive navigation, and working project pages.

## ðŸ”­ Looking Ahead

This portfolio represents more than a course project â€” itâ€™s a foundation I can build on. I plan to continue learning about:

- Interactive dashboards using Python
- Business intelligence tools like Power BI
- Creating data stories with visual tools like Plotly and Tableau

I also aim to keep updating this portfolio with new projects and insights as I grow my career in **business analytics and data storytelling**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Thoughts

Reflecting on this process has helped me realize how much progress Iâ€™ve made â€” not just technically, but in how I think, communicate, and organize my work. I now have a portfolio that not only presents what Iâ€™ve done, but also who I am becoming as a professional.
